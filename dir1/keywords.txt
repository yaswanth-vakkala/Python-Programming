Keywords are the reserved words in Python. We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier.
They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

Below are the key words in python:

False               def                 if                  raise
None                del                 import              return
True                elif                in                  try
and                 else                is                  while
as                  except              lambda              with
assert              finally             nonlocal            yield
break               for                 not
class               from                or
continue            global              pass

How to check if a world is keyword or not :

import keyword

keyword.iskeyword(s) - it returns true if the given word is a keyword

keyword.kwlist - to print the list of keywords
