Global and Local variables

There are two types of variables: global variables and local variables.

Local variables:

A variable declared inside the function's body or in the local scope is known as a local variable.

ex:

def sum():
    x = float(input("Enter the number1: "))
    y = float(input("Enter the number2: "))
    sum = x + y
    return sum

print(sum())

Global variables:

In Python, a variable declared outside of the function or in global scope is known as a global variable.
This means that a global variable can be accessed inside or outside of the function.

ex:

z = 10

def func():
    global z
    z = z + 1
    print(z)

func()
print(z)
